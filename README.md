## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<summary><em>How should I smell perfume?</em></summary>

In a store: after spraying the perfume, let the alcohol evaporate first before sniffing it – otherwise, you risk being overwhelmed by the alcohol vapours. Next, smell it with short, intermittent breaths to reduce the likelihood of saturating your nose.

Avoid smelling too many scents at once to avoid olfactory fatigue, as this will affect your perception – this is often why people report that perfumes smell different in‑store.

Ideally, you should skin‑test the perfumes you like the most to see how they develop on your skin. Experience the full evolution of the scents and how they are like in the air with a proper wearing, as the scent you get from sniffing your wrist or a blotter doesn’t necessarily reflect how it will smell when you wear it.

<summary><em>What’s the difference between EDC/EDT/EDP/Parfum, etc.?</em></summary>

> “It might generally be true (though not always) that in terms of concentration, EdCs < EdT < EdP < parfum extrait, but these terms historically define the style of the fragrance more than the concentration.

> Traditionally EdCs were stylistically close to the bright, fresh, aromatic herb and citrus fragrances popularized in Cologne, Germany in the early 1700s, while parfums were much heavier and richer. EdT and EdPs came centuries later as middle ground fragrances that bridge the gap between the two styles. Before the 1990s it was also very common for any men’s fragrance to be labeled as a cologne regardless of style or concentration.”

| lighter, fresher |  | denser, richer |
| --------------- | :-: | -------------- |
| **EDC**         |  ⇆  | **EDT**        |
| **EDP**         |  ⇆  | **Parfum**     |

However, some lines have completely different perfumes placed in the same line under different concentration labels, e.g. Rochas – Moustache EDT and EDP, so the best way to know is to test them out yourself!

<summary><em>What’s the difference between designer, niche, and indie?</em></summary>

This post may help shed some light on the fuzzy boundaries about the terms.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>I like this fragrance, but it’s not for my gender. What should I do?</em></summary>

Wear the fragrances that smell good to you! If you like the fragrance, the label shouldn’t matter.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Olfactory education</em></summary>

**How can I learn what certain notes/fragrance families smell like?**

- One option is to seek out perfumes that belong to the same family; over time, you’ll be able to pick out some commonalities between them.  
- Alternatively, you can purchase olfactory education kits, e.g. from perfumery hobbyist shops.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Performance</em></summary>

**My fragrance doesn’t smell as strong/the same as it used to. What happened?**  
Many things affect how a fragrance smells, including:
- how it’s been stored (keep it cool and dark);  
- the time of day (noses are more sensitive in the morning);  
- what else you’ve been smelling (olfactory fatigue);  
- how often you re‑wear the same scent;  
- how much and where you spray;  
- skin temperature, ambient temperature, humidity, pH, hydration;  
- and even maceration (for indie‑made, made‑to‑order batches).
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>I’ve heard that this fragrance got reformulated. Is this true?</em></summary>

There’s a lot of misinformation online. Just a suggestion of reformulation is often enough to get people to SWEAR that something smells different, even if the formula is identical. Try it yourself. Note that brands don’t reformulate for “fun” or trivial cost‑savings – any minor cosmetic savings would be dwarfed by the risk of alienating loyal customers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Perfumery</em></summary>

*For future development…*
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Purchasing</em></summary>

**Should I buy this (or that) fragrance?**  
Ultimately your decision. Follow your nose – buy what you truly love, not what you merely “like.”

**Should I blind buy this fragrance?**  
Only if you’re comfortable risking your money on a scent you haven’t smelled. Reading reviews can help, but fragrance is highly subjective.

**Is this retailer reliable?**  
_Reputable:_ FragranceNet, FragranceX, AuraFragrance, Venba Fragrance, Notino  
_Against:_ Amazon, eBay (unless you’re very confident in spotting fakes).
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Recommendations</em></summary>

**I’m just starting out – what should I try?**  
Don’t blind‑buy. Smell in store if you can, or order sample sets (Sephora, Notino, etc.).  

**I’m interested in this note – do you have recommendations?**  
(To be updated – in the meantime, check Fragrantica’s note finder.)

**What fragrance gets me the most compliments?**  
No perfume is a magic attractant. Wear what makes you feel confident, and keep good hygiene – scent is not a substitute for that.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Usage</em></summary>

- **How many sprays?** It depends on season and scent. Colder = more sprays, warmer = fewer. Start with 1–2, then adjust. Be mindful of others’ sensitivities.  
- **Where to spray?** Pulse points (wrists, neck), or lightly on clothing/hair.  
- **Occasion/season?** Some are more “heavy” (winter), others more airy (summer), but it’s up to you.  
- **How long does 30/50/100 ml last?** Varies by usage frequency and projection.

## ⚖️ Disciplinary Framework

We want Scented Waters to be a conducive place for discussion and learning. To that end, we are streamlining the existing server rules and standardising their enforcement by introducing a disciplinary framework, which replaces the old set of rules.  

The framework lists common offence categories and establishes **baseline disciplinary actions** (under “1st offence”) for each, with room for deviation based on the mods’ discretion. For example, mitigated or aggravated penalties may be applied depending on the circumstances (see below under “Aggravated” and “Highly aggravated” columns). Mods also have the latitude to take action on any offences not listed below, as well as any severe infractions targeting server members in private messages. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

For accountability, any actions taken (time‑out and above) should be announced publicly by the mod who took the action. If there are **deviations from the baseline**, the mod will need to **justify their choice of action** in the announcement. Offences are also logged internally, and repeat offenders will face more severe penalties. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

For minor infractions (time‑out or warning), amnesty will be granted after 6 months. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

Upon the publishing of this framework on **5 July 2022**, all existing members were granted a **clean slate** with no consideration of past offences for the purposes of the internal log. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

This database may be subjected to future changes – please use this page as the most up‑to‑date version of the framework. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
