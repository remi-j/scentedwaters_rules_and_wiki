## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>General</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><em>How should I smell perfume?</em></summary>

In a store: after spraying the perfume, let the alcohol evaporate first before sniffing it¬†‚Äì otherwise, you risk being overwhelmed by the alcohol vapours. Next, smell it with short, intermittent breaths to reduce the likelihood of saturating your nose.

Avoid smelling too many scents at once to avoid olfactory fatigue, as this will affect your perception¬†‚Äì this is often why people report that perfumes smell different in‚Äëstore.

Ideally, you should skin‚Äëtest the perfumes you like the most to see how they develop on your skin. Experience the full evolution of the scents and how they are like in the air with a proper wearing, as the scent you get from sniffing your wrist or a blotter doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect how it will smell when you wear it.

<summary><em>What‚Äôs the difference between EDC/EDT/EDP/Parfum, etc.?</em></summary>

> ‚ÄúIt might generally be true (though not always) that in terms of concentration, EdCs¬†<¬†EdT¬†<¬†EdP¬†<¬†parfum extrait, but these terms historically define the style of the fragrance more than the concentration.

> Traditionally EdCs were stylistically close to the bright, fresh, aromatic herb and citrus fragrances popularized in Cologne, Germany in the early¬†1700s, while parfums were much heavier and richer. EdT and EdPs came centuries later as middle ground fragrances that bridge the gap between the two styles. Before the¬†1990s it was also very common for any men‚Äôs fragrance to be labeled as a cologne regardless of style or concentration.‚Äù

| lighter, fresher |  | denser, richer |
| --------------- | :-: | -------------- |
| **EDC**         |  ‚áÜ  | **EDT**        |
| **EDP**         |  ‚áÜ  | **Parfum**     |

However, some lines have completely different perfumes placed in the same line under different concentration labels (e.g. Rochas‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØMoustache‚ÄØEDT vs.‚ÄØEDP), so the best way to know is to test them yourself!
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>What‚Äôs the difference between designer, niche, and indie?</em></summary>

This post may help shed some light on the fuzzy boundaries around these terms.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>I like this fragrance, but it‚Äôs not for my gender. What should I do?</em></summary>

Wear the fragrances that smell good to you! If you like the fragrance, the label shouldn‚Äôt matter.
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Olfactory education</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><em>How can I learn what certain notes/fragrance families smell like?</em></summary>

- Seek out several perfumes within the same family; over time you‚Äôll detect the common thread.  
- Purchase olfactory education kits from perfumery hobbyist shops.
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Performance</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><em>My fragrance doesn‚Äôt smell as strong/the same as it used to. What happened?</em></summary>

Many factors influence a fragrance‚Äôs performance, including:
- Storage conditions (cool, dark is best)  
- Time of day (noses are more sensitive in the morning)  
- Recent exposures (olfactory fatigue)  
- Frequency of wear (the brain filters repeated scents)  
- Amount and placement of sprays  
- Skin and ambient temperature, humidity, pH, hydration  
- Maceration (especially for made‚Äëto‚Äëorder indie batches)
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Reformulation</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><em>I‚Äôve heard that this fragrance got reformulated. Is this true?</em></summary>

There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation out there. A mere suggestion of reformulation can make people swear the scent changed, even if the formula is identical. The surest test is your own nose: compare batches side by side. Brands rarely reformulate without a compelling reason, as the risk of upsetting loyal customers typically outweighs any cost savings.

<summary><strong>Perfumery</strong></summary>

*For future development‚Ä¶*
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Purchasing</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><em>Should I buy this (or that) fragrance?</em></summary>

Ultimately your choice. Follow your nose‚Äîbuy what you truly love, not what you merely ‚Äúlike.‚Äù
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Should I blind buy this fragrance?</em></summary>

Only if you‚Äôre comfortable risking the cost on a scent you haven‚Äôt smelled. Reviews help, but fragrance is highly subjective.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Is this retailer reliable?</em></summary>

**Reputable:** FragranceNet, FragranceX, AuraFragrance, Venba Fragrance, Notino  
**Avoid (unless very confident):** Amazon, eBay
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Recommendations</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><em>I‚Äôm just starting out‚Äîwhat should I try?</em></summary>

Don‚Äôt blind-buy. Smell in-store if possible, or order sample sets from Sephora, Notino, etc.
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>I‚Äôm interested in this note‚Äîdo you have recommendations?</em></summary>

(To be updated‚Äîmeanwhile, check Fragrantica‚Äôs note finder.)
</details>

<details>
<summary><em>What fragrance gets me the most compliments?</em></summary>

No perfume is a magic attractant. Wear what makes you feel confident and practice good hygiene‚Äîscent isn‚Äôt a substitute for that.
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Usage</strong></summary>

- **How many sprays?** Colder weather calls for more sprays, warmer for fewer. Start with 1‚Äì2 and adjust.  
- **Where to spray?** Pulse points‚Äîwrists, neck‚Äîor lightly on clothing/hair.  
- **Occasion/season?** Heavier scents for winter, lighter for summer, but personal preference rules.  
- **How long will 30/50/100‚ÄØml last?** Depends on frequency of wear and projection.
